/**
 * A simple PagedListAdapter that binds Cheese items into CardViews.
 * <p>
 * PagedListAdapter is a RecyclerView.Adapter base class which can present the content of PagedLists
 * in a RecyclerView. It requests new pages as the user scrolls, and handles new PagedLists by
 * computing list differences on a background thread, and dispatching minimal, efficient updates to
 * the RecyclerView to ensure minimal UI thread work.
 * <p>
 * If you want to use your own Adapter base class, try using a PagedListAdapterHelper inside your
 * adapter instead.
