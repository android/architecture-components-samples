Github Browser Sample with Android Architecture Components
===========================================================

This is a sample app that uses Android Architecture Components with Dagger 2.

**NOTE** It is a relatively more complex and complete example so if you are not familiar
with [Architecture Components][arch], you are highly recommended to check other examples
in this repository first.

Introduction
-------------

### Functionality
The app is composed of 3 main screens.
#### SearchFragment
Allows you to search repositories on Github.
Each search result is kept in the database in `RepoSearchResult` table where
the list of repository IDs are denormalized into a single column.
The actual `Repo` instances live in the `Repo` table.

Each time a new page is fetched, the same `RepoSearchResult` record in the
Database is updated with the new list of repository ids.

**NOTE** The UI currently loads all `Repo` items at once, which would not
perform well on lower end devices. Instead of manually writing lazy
adapters, we've decided to wait until the built in support in Room is released.

#### RepoFragment
This fragment displays the details of a repository and its contributors.
#### UserFragment
This fragment displays a user and their repositories.

### Building
You can open the project in Android studio and press run.
### Testing
The project uses both instrumentation tests that run on the device
and local unit tests that run on your computer.
To run both of them and generate a coverage report, you can run:

`./gradlew fullCoverageReport` (requires a connected device or an emulator)

#### Device Tests
##### UI Tests
The projects uses Espresso for UI testing. Since each fragment
is limited to a ViewModel, each test mocks related ViewModel to
run the tests.
##### Database Tests
The project creates an in memory database for each database test but still
runs them on the device.

#### Local Unit Tests
##### ViewModel Tests
Each ViewModel is tested using local unit tests with mock Repository
implementations.
##### Repository Tests
Each Repository is tested using local unit tests with mock web service and
mock database.
##### Webservice Tests
The project uses [MockWebServer][mockwebserver] project to test REST api interactions.
