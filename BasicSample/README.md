Android Architecture Components Basic Sample
=============================================

This sample showcases the following Architecture Components:

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
* [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/ViewModel.html)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LiveData.html)

Introduction

### Features

This sample contains two screens: a list of products and a detail view, that shows product reviews.

#### Presentation layer

The presentation layer consists of the following components:
* A main activity that handles navigation.
* A fragment to display the list of products.
* A fragment to display a product review.

The app uses a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for the presentation layer. Each of the fragments corresponds to a MVVM View. The View and ViewModel communicate  using LiveData and the following design principles:

* ViewModel objects don't have references to activities, fragments, or Android views. That would cause leaks on configuration changes, such as a screen rotation, because the system retains a ViewModel across the entire lifecycle of the corresponding view.

* ViewModel objects expose data using `LiveData` objects. `LiveData` allows you to observe changes to data across multiple components of your app without creating explicit and rigid dependency paths between them.

* Views, including the fragments used in this sample, subscribe to corresponding `LiveData` objects. Because `LiveData` is lifecycle-aware, it doesnâ€™t push changes to the underlying data if the observer is not in an active state, and this helps to avoid many common bugs. This is an example of a subscription:

```java
        // Update the list of products when the underlying data changes.
        viewModel.getProducts().observe(this, new Observer<List<ProductEntity>>() {
            @Override
            public void onChanged(@Nullable List<ProductEntity> myProducts) {
                if (myProducts != null) {
                    mBinding.setIsLoading(false);
                    mProductAdapter.setProductList(myProducts);
                } else {
                    mBinding.setIsLoading(true);
                }
            }
        });
```

#### Data layer

The database is created using Room and it has two entities: a `ProductEntity` and a `CommentEntity` that generate corresponding SQLite tables at runtime.

Room populates the database asynchronously when it's created, via the `RoomDatabase#Callback`. To simulate low-performance, an artificial delay is added. To let 
 other components know when the data has finished populating, the `AppDatabase` exposes a 
 `LiveData` object.

To access the data and execute queries, you use a [Data Access Object](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html#daos) (DAO). For example, a product is loaded with the following query:

```java
    @Query("select * from products where id = :productId")
    LiveData<ProductEntity> loadProduct(int productId);
```

Queries that return a `LiveData` object can be observed, so when  a change in one of the affected tables is detected, `LiveData` delivers a notification of that change to the registered observers.

The `DataRepository` exposes the data to the UI layer. To ensure that the UI uses the list of products only after the database has been pre-populated, a [`MediatorLiveData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/MediatorLiveData.html) object is used. This 
observes the changes of the list of products and only forwards it when the database is ready to be used.
