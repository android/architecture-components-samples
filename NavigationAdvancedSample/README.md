Android Architecture Components Advanced Navigation Sample
==============================================

### Features

This sample showcases the behavior of a bottom navigation view following the [Principles of
Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation#fixed).

 * Fixed start destination
 * Navigation state should be represented via a stack of destinations
 * The Up button never exits your app
 * Up and Back are identical within your app's task
 * Deep linking and navigating to a destination should yield the same stack

Check out the
[UI tests](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/NavigationAdvancedSample/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/android/navigationadvancedsample)
